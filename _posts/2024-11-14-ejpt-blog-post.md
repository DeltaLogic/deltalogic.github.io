## eJPT an exciting first venture

This past Sunday, I decided I would finally attempt the Junior Penetration Tester exam. This came after realizing I had four attempts that expired early in the upcoming year.

### Thoughts
Truthfully speaking, this exam was the perfect confidence booster for showing competence in Cyber. Despite my disorganization, I felt everything that I needed to pass was provided by INE, the course provider. When I hit a wall, I dug in checked my notes, and ensured I enumerated all I could. I probably spent a total of 18 hours actively completing the exam, what was left of the 48 hours I had spent time in the Red Dragon Inn, battled with munchkins, and slept.

### Tips

The biggest tip, ENUMERATE, ENUMERATE, ENUMERATE.

After you've enumerated more than you feel you needed to, organize what you have, and then start following whatever methodology you've made for yourself. I personally tried to follow the basic pentest methodology INE taught.

Sure its a multiple choice exam, but please follow through your leads to the end. Pull all the strings till you're out of yarn. You will find answers just by treating it like a normal penetration test, just if something feels like its taking too long. It probably is, you have 48 hours so if your gut tells you something may be there you can always circle back.

Finally, YES I know I just said this, but its a multiple choice exam. If you are more lost than a goblin in the middle of an elvish eatery, you can refer to those answers to help guide you to the correct path. DO NOT treat this like a CTF INE is looking for things that you do in the VM so if you don't follow things a standard pentest would provide you will lose points. To reiterate, multiple choice answers only as a last resort to give a nudge to the right path
